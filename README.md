## üîÅ Examples

### Start a feature and push

```bash
git-flow-sync start feature navbar-update
```

### Finish a release and trigger CI

```bash
git-flow-sync finish release v1.4.0 --ci-url https://ci.example.com/deploy
```

### Safely cleanup tracking-deleted local branches

```bash
git-flow-sync cleanup --verbose
```

### Force delete all stale local branches (no prompt)

```bash
git-flow-sync cleanup --force
```

- Uncommitted changes are auto-stashed before `finish`
- Never deletes local branches without prompt (unless `--force` is set)
- Supports `--dry-run` for all destructive operations
